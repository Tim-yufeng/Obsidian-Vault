Today is meant to be a special day in my life(maybe a little bit exaggerated?). I was informed by an email, that I was hired as the TA of CHEM 2100.   

Honestly speaking, that's crazy, too crazy. I would say submitting the TA application form and made the click "accept" is perhaps the craziest thing I've ever done, in my entire college life! What the hell am I thinking that time? Longing for the payment? Longing for respect? 

Well, since I entered this university, one thing in my mind never changed, that I want to be someone that is super excellent, that can even scare myself badly. Indeed, being a TA did scare me badly. I'm totally not sure whether this is a wise choice. So, whatever, we'll see the answer, maybe several months later. 

Anyway, I actually did nothing this moring (morning? You wake up at 10 a.m.!) So, ah, it seems I have to work right now.
