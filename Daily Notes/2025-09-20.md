## ✨ 今日总结
- Here's the thing, I'm tired out after waking up before 8 am and attend the meeting for TA training for 4 hours. I have a scholarship defence to attend 50 minutes later, and I'm going to sleep for a while.
- Now I have just finished the scholarship defence. The only feeling I have at this moment, is void. Totally at a lost, having no purpose and passion for anything. I may go swimming after typing these sentences. As for the 286 notes, and PRP tasks? Well,  leave them to this evening. 
- Many things gonna happen next week, and I believe it's time to adopt a more effective method to remind me of things to be done. Perhaps the same way in senior high will be helpful.
- So, let's make a list about everything to think of:
1. 286
2. 270
3. 215
4. 250
5. 物理实验
6. TC 300
7. TA Work
8. PRP
9. Other stuff
