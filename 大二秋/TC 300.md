- [x] Lecture 1 self-intro preparation ⏫ 📅 2025-09-24 ✅ 2025-09-24
	Hello everyone, my name is Yufeng Jin, a sophomore student majoring in ECE. My interests include swimming, cycling, and sleeping. As for my plan of studying, I don't want to DD or GDP. Instead, I wish to study for my postgraduate degree at SJTU.  
	
	To work as a team, I think I'm good at using latex, so I can contribute a lot to paper writing. I'm not good at coding, instead I'm more advanced in hardware, like 3D modeling. 
	%% I wish that in our team, everyone can work in a effective but not anxious manner. All of us can contribute to part of the project and solve each problem together. Regardless of our different personalities, time arrangement, we can work as a team and treat others with patience.  %%
	What I expect from our group is that we can **work effectively but without unnecessary stress**, and that everyone can take responsibility for their part while helping each other when encountering challenges. I also hope we can **respect each other’s different personalities and schedules**, and always keep patience and collaboration in mind.
