Hello everyone! I'm Jin Yufeng, one of the Chemistry 2100J teaching team. It's my first time being a TA, and this is my first RC. Before talking about Chemistry, I want to say, I'm really grateful to all of you that come to RC tonight, since it's the National holiday, and you are not required to attend it. (And I believe some of you might have already gone home. )

Let's begin our today's topic. Here's our agenda. We'll first review some key concepts in Chapter 3, covering chemical bonds, Lewis structure, formal charge, electronegativity, and so on. 
Next is the practice part. We'll go through several problems. These problems will help you consolidate what you've learnt in class, and let you know what will be tested in exam. 
Finally are the common mistakes and upcoming contents, homework and short exam that I want to remind you. 

As you may have discovered, this chapter is all about chemical bonds, (ionic bond, covalent bond, bond strength, bond length, how to predict bonds. )
So how are chemical bonds formed? In middle school, we already learnt that an atom is always trying to fill its outer shell, because it's a more stable structure. There are two ways for an atom to do that, one is to lose or gain electrons, and the other is to share electrons with other atoms. In the first way, the bonds formed are called ionic bond, and the latter one, the bonds are called covalent bond. (When chemical bonds are formed, the overall energy is lowered)

How to know which kind of bond atom will adopt? Ionic bond are typically formed between an s-block metal and a nonmetallic element, for example, calcium(sodium) and chlorine. 

The strength of ionic bond is closely related to a global characteristic (it's a characteristic of the entire crystal), called **lattice energy**. The higher lattice energy is, the stronger the ionic bonds are. 

To compare the strength of ionic bond, you just need to remember that, a smaller radius and a higher charge can contribute to stronger bond strength and a higher lattice energy. 
(Anyone remember the definition of lattice energy? It's the net lowering of energy during the formation of the crystal. Or put it in another way, the energy you gain after atoms form into ionic solid)

Here's the formula for calculating the Coulomb’s Potential Energy.
I think you need to remember this formula, because there may be a calculation problem in the exam, that requires you to apply this equation to calculate the Coulomb's potential energy of a molecule. Also, you need to remember that the potential energy accounts for several properties of ionic solid, such as the high melting point, the brittleness. 

Now let's talk about covalent bond. It's normally formed between two nonmetal elements. There are single bond, double bond, and triple bond. The number of bond is equal to the number of shared electron pair. For the bond order, you will learn that in the MO theory. (Have you learnt that already?) At this stage, you can just remember that the bond order is equal to the number of bonds.

Here's the Octet Rule. Atoms will try to reach a noble-gas configuration by sharing electrons. For period 1 elements, it means keeping 2 electrons on the outer shell. For others, it means 8 electrons. You must remember one thing, that these 4 elements: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, they strictly obey octet rule.

However, there are also some exceptions, like aluminum chloride, the number of electrons on the outer shell of aluminum is less than 8. And for this substance, the number of phosphor's outer shell electrons is greater than 8. For period 3 or subsequent element, there might be over 8 electrons on the outer shell. It's typically less than 12, and the maximum is 18. Also for some special molecules, such as radicals, there might exist unpaired electrons. 

Next part is very important, the drawing of Lewis structure. 
Firstly, we calculate the overall valence electrons. Secondly, we determine the central atom. There is a rule for the determination. 
Actually it's more like experience. The central atom tends to be the element with the lowest ionization energy. But of course there are exceptions. For example $NO_2$. ()

Thirdly, we connect atoms with one bond. Then, we calculate the remaining electrons. As we know, each bond is formed by two electrons, so we need to expel the electrons used for forming bonds. Then we fill the remaining electrons to the elements. 
Finally we try to let every element satisfy the octet rule, and add charge if needed. 

Next concept is also very important, I think. You need to remember how to use this formula. For an atom in a molecule, its formal charge is the origin outer shell electrons, minus the lone electrons and half of the bonding electrons. Actually half of the bonding electrons is just the number of bonds connected to that atom. 
(Briefly talk about the example on the slide)
Actually, as you may have discovered, for a molecule with no extra charge (an electroneutral molecule), the sum of formal charge of all atoms must be equal to 0. 

Next part, the resonance structure, I think is the most difficult and abstract part of this chapter. But the good news is, it's not that important. The exam won't test it too deep. 
About resonance structure, firstly, it's actually not a fact, just a theory. It's just a theory to compensate for the limitation of Lewis theory. For example, the nitrate radical. If we draw its Lewis structure, we can see that there are 1 double bond and 2 single bonds, right? Then obviously, the length of these three bonds are not equal. However, from the experimental result, they turned out to be equal. That proved to be a limitation of Lewis theory. In order to compensate for it, the theory of resonance structure was raised. 

About this figure, you shouldn't think of it as rotations of the same molecule. Instead, it indicates that the electrons can be located at any of these three orbits. So these three structures, they are not the same Lewis structures. (since their electrons distributions are not the same) Which one is the real structure of this molecule? None of them, they are all theory, (including this picture, it's just a theory), the real molecule is a hybrid of these three theoretical structure. So that explains why in the real structure of NO3, the three bonds are of the same length. 

Next concept is much easier, and I believe that you have been very familiar with it since high school. You only need to remember what it measures (read the slide), and the trend of its magnitude (read the slide).
It can be used to judge whether a bond is ionic or covalent, by calculating the difference of the electronegativity. 

This is the last concept, bond strength and bond length. I think it's also quite easy. You guys must have practiced such things a lot in high school chemistry.
So remember the definition of bond strength. 
- triple is stronger than double, and double is stronger than single
- two single bonds are stronger than one double bond (since sigma bond is stronger than pi bond)
- lone pair can have repelled effects and weaken the bond
- resonance, radii ……
After reviewing, let's do some exercises.
