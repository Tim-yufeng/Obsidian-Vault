## Vapor Pressure
talks about my own interpretation: static point of view

## Clausius - Clapeyron equation

What we can derive from this equation?
- interpretation of boiling point
- obtaining one point (like the boiling point under 1 atm), you can obtain the whole curve
- enthalpy of vaporization: also reflects intermolecular interaction strength

## Phase diagram

How slope determine the relative density of different phase? My own interpretation

## Solubility: Henry's Law
So what's the unit of Henry's constant?
$\text{mol} \cdot (\text{L}\cdot \text{Pa})^{-1}$
