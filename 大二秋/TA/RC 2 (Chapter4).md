Hello everyone! Like last RC, let's first review the contents in this chapter. Next we will go through several problems to help you practise what you have learnt. Finally is some reminders, about some common mistakes and previews. 

This chapter is divided into three parts, introduced three molecular theory, VSEPR, Valence-bond theory, and Molecular Orbital theory. The former two theories, I think you guys might already knew it in high school. The latter one, the MO theory, is much more abstract and hard to understand. 
%% But luckily, to deal with the exam, you don't have to dive too deep into it, completely understand what's going on there. You just need to remember the method, how to fill electrons into the diagram. 
 %%
 Firstly，the VSEPR model. Regions of high electron density, either bonding or lone pairs, will repel each other to minimize repulsion. 
 And in VSEPR, multiple bonds have no difference with the single bond. 
 And here, be careful with the difference with the molecular shape and VSEPR electron arrangement. ^^^ So you need to be careful with what the question ask you. 
^^^
Neext concept is generic formula, this is quite easy. It's just a notation of electron arrangement of a molecule. ^^^

This table is very important, I think you'd better copy that in your cheating paper. 

Next concept is polarity. In this part, you need to know how to judge whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar. 
^^^
All you need to do is draw the model of the molecule correctly, and see whether it's symmetric. If it is, ^^^

So here is the standard steps for you to follow. If you encounter a problem in the exam, asking you, given the chemical formula of a molecule, whether it is polar or nonpolar. For example, this molecule, BF3. You are required to follow these steps, ^^^^^^
^^^
So that's all for VSEPR, next is the valence-bond theory. 
^^^
The essence of valence-bond theory is hybrid orbitals. 


In the silde, it says that every AO produces an MO. It's actually incorrect.
