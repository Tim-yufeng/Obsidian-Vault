1. Every day before going to bed, check the mission list that day. Cross those finished ones, leaving others to the next day's mission. (Build next day's daily note as well)
2. Never build implicitly defined mission!!! For each mission, clarify:
	- Category (subjects, prp or others)
	- what need to be done
	- deadline
	- priority
3. Use mission block only in following-lecture homework, which are supposed to be written in lecture notes. In daily notes, just use number or dot list, mark accomplishment with a ~~dash. 
4. Ensuring each mission is assigned with at most one mission block!
5. Always remember to check the all-mission board!
